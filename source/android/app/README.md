# Usage Guide - DEMO

## Before Run

Before building the SDK, please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Git:** Ensure that Git is installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). Or using the following command:

	```bash
	# add this line to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile, the android sdk will work
	export ANDROID_SDK=<your sdk path>

# üìåHow to integrate RedPlayer into your Android project

## Requirements

- Android Phone System 5.0+

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Create a PlayerDemo Project

Start by creating a new android project named `PlayerDemo`

### 2. Setup Dependency

In the root directory of your project, create a `app module` and open the  `build.gradle` file

```java
// add the RedPlayer SDK and RedPreload SDK
dependencies {
    implementation project(path: ':OpenRedPlayerCore')
    implementation project(path: ':OpenRedPreload')
}   
```

This module includes dependencies on local **RedPlayer SDK**, **RedPreload SDK** and **ffmpeg**, **opensoundtouch**.

### 3. Build & Install

Run the following command in the terminal to build and install your demo:

```
$ ./gradlew installDebug
```
Then you `app module` will build the apk and auto install you android phone.
